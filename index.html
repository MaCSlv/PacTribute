                <li>Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem in Manhattan, New York.</li>
                <li>His mother, Afeni Shakur, and father, Billy Garland, were active members of the Black Panthers in New York in the late 1960s and 1970s; he was born just a month after his mother's acquittal in more than 150 "conspiracy" cases against the US government.</li>
                <li>At the age of twelve, Shakur enrolled in the 127th Street Repertory Ensemble of Harlem, a theater group, and was cast as the character Travis Younger in the play A Raising in the Sun, which was performed at the Apollo Theater. In 1986, his family moves to Baltimore, Maryland. After completing his sophomore year at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, he transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He acted in some Shakespeare plays and also acted as the King of the Rats in The Nutcracker.</li>
                <li>In June 1988, Tupac and his family moved once more, this time to Marin City in the Bay Area, California, where he attended Tamalpais High School. He began attending poetry classes with Leila Steinberg in 1989, who eventually became his mentor and manager. That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with Shakur's former band Strictly Dope; that gig led to him signing a contract with Atron Gregory that put him as a roadie and dancer for the rap group Digital Underground. While living in Marin City, Tupac became involved in drug dealing and due to arguments with his mother, he ended up leaving home and being homeless for some time, often going to live with friends and his brother Mopreme in Oakland.</li>
